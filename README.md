### Question two
- It is done for all roles (Guest, User, Agent, and Admin).
- The code now has the SQLi and XSS.

### Question three
- All users are now authorized and authenticated.

- Guests (no authentication required).
- Registered users (authenticated with a username, password and active/suspend).
- Agents (authenticated with a username and password).
- Admin (agent with id 2 is an admin).

- The access matrix for the four users has been achieved 

### Question four
- All passwords are salted.
- Passwords are not transmitted in plain text between the browser and the server.
- The passwords' length is between 8 and 16 characters.
- when admin creates an agent account admin puts password for the new agent, but then agent can change the password at anytime.
- All passwords stored in the database are encrypted and salted.
